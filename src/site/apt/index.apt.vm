${project.name} (${project.artifactId})

  The ${project.artifactId} allows you to deploy, redeploy or undeploy applications to JBoss Application Server 7. You
  can also deploy resources and artifacts like datasources.  With {{{./deploy-mojo.html#force}force}} set to <<<true>>>
  the {{{./deploy-mojo.html}deploy}} goal will <<<redeploy>>> the application if the deployment already exists on the s
  erver. By default <<<force>>> is set to <<<true>>>.

  If the {{{./deploy-mojo.html#packaging}packaging type}} is of type <<<pom>>> or <<<maven-plugin>>> all execution of
  all goals for this plugin are ignored.

* Goals Overview

  General information about the goals.

  * {{{./add-resource-mojo.html}jboss-as:add-resource}} adds a resource.

  * {{{./deploy-mojo.html}jboss-as:deploy}} deploys the application.

  * {{{./deploy-artifact-mojo.html}jboss-as:deploy-artifact}} deploys an arbitrary artifact to the server.

  * {{{./redeploy-mojo.html}jboss-as:redeploy}} redeploys the application.

  * {{{./undeploy-mojo.html}jboss-as:undeploy}} undeploys the application.

* Usage

  General instructions on how to use the ${project.name} can be found on the {{{./usage.html}usage page}}. Some more
  specific use cases are described in the examples given below. Last but not least, users occasionally contribute
  additional examples, tips or errata to the
  {{{http://community.jboss.org/en/jbossas}JBoss Application Server wiki page}}.

  In case you still have questions regarding the plugin's usage, please have a look at the {{{./faq.html}FAQ}} and feel
  free to contact the {{{./mail-lists.html}user mailing list}}. The posts to the mailing list are archived and could
  already contain the answer to your question as part of an older thread. Hence, it is also worth browsing/searching
  the {{{./mail-lists.html}mail archive}}.

  If you feel like the plugin is missing a feature or has a defect, you can fill a feature request or bug report in our
  {{{./issue-tracking.html}issue tracker}}. When creating a new issue, please provide a comprehensive description of your
  concern. Especially for fixing bugs it is crucial that the developers can reproduce your problem. For this reason,
  entire debug logs, POMs or most preferably little demo projects attached to the issue are very much appreciated.
  Of course, patches are welcome, too. Contributors can check out the project from our
  {{{./source-repository.html}source repository}} and will find supplementary information in the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-helping.html}guide to helping with Maven}}.
